Overview:
The "Sea_Beach_View_Using_Glut" project is a 2D graphics project that aims to simulate a serene sea beach view using the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) library. The project leverages OpenGL's capabilities to create an immersive and visually appealing depiction of a beach scene. This project is an excellent example of how computer graphics can create realistic and interactive environments.


Features:

Realistic Beach Scene: The project offers a realistic representation of a sea beach, complete with a sunlit sky, sandy shoreline, and gentle waves.
Dynamic Waves: The waves in the sea are dynamically animated, providing a lifelike sense of movement and realism to the scene.

Sunset Effect: The project employs lighting techniques to simulate a sunset ambience, with warm hues and soft shadows that create a tranquil atmosphere.
User Interaction: Users can interact with the scene by adjusting parameters like the sun's position, wave speed, and more, allowing them to customize the visual experience.
